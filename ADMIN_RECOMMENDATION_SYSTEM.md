## Scoring System

### Individual Dimension Scores (0-100)
- **80-100**: EXCELLENT - Strongly recommend approval
- **60-79**: GOOD - Recommend approval with minor conditions
- **40-59**: ADEQUATE - Request revisions before approval
- **0-39**: WEAK - Major concerns, recommend rejection

### Overall Feasibility Score
Calculated as weighted average:
```
Overall Score = (Technical × 0.35) + (Financial × 0.35) + (Risk × 0.30)
```

### Recommendation Actions
- **APPROVE**: All dimensions score well (typically >70), minimal concerns
- **CONDITIONAL_APPROVE**: Generally good scores (50-70) but some specific conditions need addressing
- **REQUEST_REVISIONS**: Low scores (<50) or critical issues identified requiring resubmission

## Example Output Samples

### Technical Feasibility (High Score)
```
Technical Score: 95/100
Rating: EXCELLENT

Assessment:
The project demonstrates very strong technical feasibility, with detailed 
engineering design, adherence to relevant national standards (IRC, IS codes), 
and robust design considerations for challenging site conditions like high 
seismicity (Zone V) and river hydrology. The proposed Prestressed Concrete 
Box Girder design is appropriate for the 1,850m span, and the deep well 
foundations (18m) provide adequate scour protection.

Strengths:
✓ Modern Prestressed Concrete Box Girder bridge design
✓ Adequate bridge length (1,850m) for river width (1,600m)
✓ Deep Well Foundations (18m) into stable bearing stratum
✓ Comprehensive IRC and IS code compliance
✓ Robust seismic design (Zone V) with ductile detailing
✓ Clear construction methodology (well sinking, climbing formwork)

Areas for Improvement:
⚠ High seismic activity (Zone V) requires stringent quality control
⚠ High annual rainfall (2,850 mm) presents construction challenges
```

### Financial Feasibility (Critical Issues Found)
```
Financial Score: 45/100
Rating: ADEQUATE

Assessment:
The proposed budget of Rs. 245.5 Crores has significant concerns. A critical 
GST calculation error was identified: the DPR states "Add: GST @ 12% 1.62 Crores" 
on Rs. 243.88 Crores, but 12% should equal Rs. 29.27 Crores, not Rs. 1.62 Crores. 
This fundamental error makes the total project cost unreliable. Additionally, 
the 5% "cost rationalization" appears arbitrary without proper justification.

Strengths:
✓ Strong economic indicators (EIRR: 18.5%, BCR: 2.3:1, NPV: Rs. 425 Cr)
✓ Clear 90:10 central-state funding mechanism
✓ Detailed cost breakdown with BOQ

Budget Concerns:
⚠ CRITICAL: GST calculation error - Should be Rs. 29.27 Cr, not Rs. 1.62 Cr (Severity: Critical)
⚠ Arbitrary 5% cost rationalization without justification (Severity: Medium)
⚠ 3% contingency may be inadequate for high-risk project (Severity: Low)
```

### Risk Assessment
```
Risk Score: 72/100
Rating: GOOD

Assessment:
The DPR demonstrates good risk awareness with identified risks across financial, 
timeline, environmental, and resource categories. Flood risk during construction 
has been addressed with scheduling, forecasting, and Rs. 12 Crores contingency. 
However, some mitigation strategies could be more detailed, particularly for 
seismic events and foundation challenges.

Risk Management Strengths:
✓ Comprehensive risk identification across categories
✓ Dedicated Rs. 12 Cr contingency for flood risks
✓ Seismic design with ductile detailing (IS:1893)
✓ Detailed soil investigation completed
✓ Insurance coverage provision

Risk Concerns:
⚠ Flood risk during construction (High severity, Medium probability)
⚠ Cost escalation with only 3% contingency (Medium severity, High probability)
⚠ Foundation challenges may cause 2-month delay (Medium severity, Medium probability)
```

### Overall Recommendation (Conditional Approval)
```
Action: CONDITIONAL APPROVE
Overall Score: 71/100
Confidence: 85%

Executive Summary:
The bridge project demonstrates strong technical feasibility with excellent 
engineering design and appropriate construction methodology. However, a critical 
GST calculation error in the financial section requires immediate correction - 
the stated total of Rs. 245.5 Crores is mathematically incorrect. Conditionally 
approve this project pending submission of a revised DPR that corrects the GST 
calculation, increases contingency fund from 3% to 5% given the high-risk nature, 
and provides justification for the 5% cost rationalization deduction. Upon 
receiving these revisions, the project can proceed to full approval.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Download DPR button not working
**Solution**: Check that `file_path` in document metadata is correct and file exists in backend `/uploads` folder

### Issue: Recommendation loading forever
**Solution**: 
1. Check backend terminal for errors
2. Verify Gemini API key is configured
3. Ensure DPR text is not empty (minimum 100 characters)
4. Check network connectivity to Gemini API

### Issue: Three bars not displaying
**Solution**:
1. Verify backend returns proper JSON structure with `assessment` object
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure `get_recommendation=true` parameter is sent to backend

### Issue: Scores not calculating correctly
**Solution**: Backend calculates weighted average automatically - verify weights sum to 100% (35% + 35% + 30%)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Export Recommendation Report**: Generate PDF report of full analysis
2. **Comparison View**: Compare multiple DPR submissions side-by-side
3. **Historical Analytics**: Track approval rates and common issues
4. **Custom Weighting**: Allow admins to adjust importance weights
5. **Collaborative Review**: Multiple admins can review and comment
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete decision history with reasoning logs

## Security Considerations

- Admin authentication required for all review operations
- DPR files stored securely in backend `/uploads` directory
- API endpoints protected with CORS and authentication middleware
- Sensitive data not logged in console outputs
- Gemini API key stored in environment variables
