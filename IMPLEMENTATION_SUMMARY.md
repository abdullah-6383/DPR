- Border: 2px solid Blue 500/50
- Icon: Settings/Cog (‚öôÔ∏è) in 14x14 gradient box
- Numbering: "1. Technical Feasibility"

**Content Structure**:

   - Height: 4px with smooth animation

3. **Assessment Section**:
   - Dark inset box with border
   - 4-5 sentences of detailed technical analysis
   - Covers: Design standards, site conditions, construction methodology

4. **Strengths & Concerns Grid**:
   - Two-column layout (50/50 split on desktop)
   - **Left**: Green section with checkmarks (‚úì) - Strengths
   - **Right**: Orange section with warnings (‚ö†) - Areas for Improvement
   - Each item: Icon + Text with proper spacing

**Backend Data Format**:
```json
{
  "technical": {
    "score": 95,
    "rating": "EXCELLENT",
    "detailed_analysis": "4-5 sentence assessment...",
    "strengths": [
      "Modern Prestressed Concrete Box Girder bridge design",
      "Adequate bridge length (1,850m) for river width",
      "Deep Well Foundations (18m) into stable bearing stratum",
      "Comprehensive IRC and IS code compliance",
      "Robust seismic design (Zone V) with ductile detailing"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "High seismic activity (Zone V) requires stringent quality control",
      "High annual rainfall (2,850 mm) presents construction challenges"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### BAR 2: Financial Feasibility (Emerald Theme)
**Visual Design**:
- Gradient background: Emerald 900/40 ‚Üí Emerald 800/30 ‚Üí Emerald 900/40
- Border: 2px solid Emerald 500/50
- Icon: Currency/Dollar (üíµ) in 14x14 gradient box
- Numbering: "2. Financial Feasibility"

**Content Structure**:
1. **Header Section**:
   - Title: "2. Financial Feasibility"
   - Subtitle: "Budget realism, economic viability & funding mechanism"
   - Rating Badge: Dynamic color based on rating
   - Score Display: "45/100" format

2. **Progress Bar**:
   - Emerald theme with gradient fill

3. **Assessment Section**:
   - Detailed budget analysis
   - Highlights critical errors (e.g., GST calculation mistakes)
   - References specific amounts and discrepancies

4. **Strengths & Budget Concerns Grid**:
   - **Left**: Green section - Financial Strengths (Economic indicators, funding)
   - **Right**: Orange section - Budget Concerns with severity labels
     - Format: "‚ö† [Issue] (Severity: Critical/Medium/Low)"

**Example Output**:
```
Assessment:
The proposed budget of Rs. 245.5 Crores has been evaluated. Some budget 
concerns have been identified:

‚ö† CRITICAL: Fundamental GST calculation error. The DPR states 'Add: GST @ 12% 
1.62 Crores' to a subtotal of Rs. 243.88 Crores. However, 12% of Rs. 243.88 
Crores should be Rs. 29.27 Crores, not Rs. 1.62 Crores. This discrepancy 
renders the 'GRAND TOTAL INCLUDING GST Rs. 245.50 Crores' mathematically 
incorrect.
```

**Backend Data Format**:
```json
{
  "financial": {
    "score": 45,
    "rating": "ADEQUATE",
    "detailed_analysis": "Budget analysis with error identification...",
    "strengths": [
      "Strong economic indicators (EIRR: 18.5%, BCR: 2.3:1, NPV: Rs. 425 Cr)",
      "Clear 90:10 central-state funding mechanism",
      "Comprehensive cost breakdown with detailed BOQ"
    ],
    "concerns": [
      "CRITICAL: GST calculation error - Should be Rs. 29.27 Cr, not Rs. 1.62 Cr (Severity: Critical)",
      "Arbitrary 5% cost rationalization without justification (Severity: Medium)",
      "3% contingency may be inadequate for high-probability cost escalation (Severity: Low)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example Output**:
```
Assessment:
Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM

The DPR demonstrates good risk awareness with identified risks across 
financial, timeline, environmental, and resource categories. Flood risk 
during construction has been addressed with scheduling, forecasting, and 
Rs. 12 Crores contingency. However, some mitigation strategies could be 
more detailed.
```

**Backend Data Format**:
```json
{
  "risk": {
    "score": 72,
    "rating": "GOOD",
    "detailed_analysis": "Risk management assessment...",
    "strengths": [
      "Comprehensive risk identification across categories",
      "Dedicated Rs. 12 Cr contingency for flood risks",
