    "budget_analysis": "The proposed project budget of Not Found has been reviewed against standard cost norms and industry benchmarks for similar infrastructure projects in the North Eastern Region. The financial analysis has identified several important considerations. Increase the contingency allocation to at least 5% of the total project cost. Provide a detailed breakdown of the cost index calculation with market comparisons. Develop detailed financial projections, including revenue forecasts and expense estimates. These aspects require immediate attention to ensure fiscal prudence and optimal resource utilization. Regular budget monitoring and variance analysis will be essential during implementation to prevent cost overruns and ensure value for money.",
    "timeline_evaluation": "The proposed project implementation timeline of Not specified has been assessed against typical execution periods for comparable infrastructure projects in the North Eastern Region. The execution timeline should account for several region-specific factors including seasonal monsoon patterns, terrain accessibility challenges, and material procurement logistics. A detailed activity schedule with clearly defined milestones and critical path analysis would strengthen the implementation plan. Adequate buffer time should be incorporated to handle unforeseen delays, particularly those related to weather conditions and logistical constraints typical of the North Eastern Region. Regular progress monitoring with quarterly reviews will be essential to ensure timely completion and early identification of potential delays.",
    "technical_feasibility": "The technical evaluation indicates generally sound engineering principles, though certain aspects would benefit from additional detail and validation. The project should incorporate detailed technical specifications covering design parameters, material quality standards, construction methodology, and quality assurance protocols. Comprehensive geological and geotechnical surveys should be conducted to validate design assumptions and identify potential ground-related challenges. Technical review at each project milestone will ensure adherence to approved standards and specifications, while also allowing for adaptive management based on field conditions.",
    "risk_assessment": "The risk evaluation reveals moderate exposure typical for infrastructure projects of this nature, requiring vigilant monitoring and proactive management. Standard project risks including cost escalation, schedule delays, quality deviations, and resource constraints should be addressed through a comprehensive risk management framework. Specific attention should be given to region-specific challenges such as seasonal accessibility, material transportation logistics, and availability of skilled workforce. A dedicated risk register should be maintained and regularly updated, with clear ownership assigned for monitoring and mitigating each identified risk throughout the project duration.",
    "actionable_recommendations": "Based on our comprehensive analysis, the following actionable recommendations are provided to strengthen this DPR and enhance the project's success potential. Increase the contingency allocation to at least 5% of the total project cost Additionally, Provide a detailed breakdown of the cost index calculation with market comparisons Additionally, Develop detailed financial projections, including revenue forecasts and expense estimates.",
    "compliance_check": "The DPR shows reasonable compliance with MDoNER guidelines, though certain areas would benefit from additional documentation and clarity. The overall structure follows required standards, but some specific sections require strengthening. Essential statutory clearances including environmental, forest, and wildlife approvals (where applicable) must be secured before project commencement. All sections mandated by MDoNER guidelines should be present with adequate depth and supporting documentation. Regular compliance audits during implementation will ensure continued adherence to approved standards and regulatory requirements.",
    "final_assessment": "Based on this comprehensive analysis, I recommend that the DPR be revised to address the concerns identified throughout this assessment. While the project shows promise and has several strong elements, the issues highlighted need to be resolved before approval. Once these revisions are made, the project should be well-positioned for successful implementation.\n\nThe DPR is incomplete and lacks sufficient financial justification, requiring revisions before approval."
