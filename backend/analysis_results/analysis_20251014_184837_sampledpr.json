The project aligns well with MDoNER's mandate for infrastructure development in the North Eastern Region. However, the critical discrepancy in the GST calculation within the budget needs immediate rectification and detailed justification. Additionally, completing the procurement section and providing a more realistic O&M outlook are essential for comprehensive project documentation. Once these revisions are satisfactorily addressed, the project merits approval."

While detailed in most aspects, a critical discrepancy in GST calculation requires immediate revision before MDoNER can grant approval. The project demonstrates strong viability with an EIRR of 18.5% and a 36-month timeline."
