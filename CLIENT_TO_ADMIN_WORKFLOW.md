# Client to Admin Review Workflow

## Overview
This document describes the complete workflow for client document submission and admin review process in the DPR Analysis Portal.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Client Upload & Analysis
1. **Client logs in** to the portal (client@project.in)
2. **Uploads DPR document** for AI analysis
3. **Views improvement report** with recommendations
4. **Reviews suggestions** to improve their DPR
5. Document status: `viewed` (after AI analysis completes)

### 2. Client Submits for Admin Review
1. **Client clicks "Submit to Admin"** button on their document card
2. Document status changes from `viewed` → `submitted`
3. **Success notification** confirms submission to admin queue
4. Client can see submission status on their dashboard

### 3. Admin Dashboard Priority View
When admin logs in (admin@mdoner.gov.in):

1. **Priority Alert Box** appears when documents need review
   - Shows count: "🔥 3 documents need your review!"
   - Displays prominent amber-colored alert at top
   - Includes "Review Now" button for quick access

2. **Enhanced Submitted Filter**
   - Amber-colored button with fire emoji: 🔥
   - Shows "Needs Review!" label when documents pending
   - Animated pulse effect to draw attention
   - Displays count: "Submitted (3)"

3. **Document List**
   - Submitted documents appear with "Submitted" status badge
   - Shows submission details and client information
   - Includes submission comments from client

### 4. Admin Review Process
1. **Admin filters** to "Submitted" status (or clicks "Review Now")
2. **Reviews each document**:
   - Click "Admin View" to see full analysis with approval recommendations
   - Reviews AI-generated approval recommendation
   - Examines detailed DPR analysis sections
   
3. **Admin makes decision**:
   - **Mark Viewed**: Document reviewed (status → `viewed`)
   - **Start Review**: Begin detailed technical review (status → `under-review`)
   - **Approve**: Document approved for implementation (status → `approved`)
   - **Reject**: Document needs revisions (status → `rejected`)

4. **Admin adds comments** explaining their decision
5. Status updated and client notified

### 5. Client Receives Feedback
1. Client sees updated status on their dashboard
2. Can view admin comments and decision
3. If rejected: Makes improvements and resubmits
4. If approved: Proceeds with project implementation

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

### Status Management
```typescript
updateDocumentStatus(
  documentId: string,
  newStatus: 'pending' | 'viewed' | 'under-review' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'submitted',
  comments: string,
  reviewedBy: { name: string, email: string }
)
```

### Filter System
```typescript
const statusCounts = {

4. Implement document versioning for resubmissions
5. Add bulk approval actions for admin efficiency
